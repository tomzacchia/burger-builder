## Description
  * I made this webApp as part of the curriculum of a Udemy React 16 course [React 16 - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/learn/v4/overview)
  * Use this webApp to personalize your burger and get a price estimate
  
## Built With

## Future Improvements / Functionality
 - [ ] Make use of LocalStorage to persist app state
 - [ ] Add routing to navigate user to "purchase page" and really turn webApp into single page application
 - [ ] Implement Redux to make managing state much simpler; compared to chaining props
 - [ ] Implement AJAX calls to save and/or store user data
